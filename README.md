Force-starts IDrive Audio Apps over USB Connections

BMW Connected and Mini Connected for Android support starting external CarAPI Apps for IDrive, such as Spotify and iHeartRadio.
However, these apps are only started if the phone is connected via Bluetooth to IDrive 5+.
This app forces those apps to start, even when the car is connected over USB.
